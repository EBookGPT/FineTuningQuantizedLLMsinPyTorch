# Introduction to Chapter 7: Automatic Quantization Aware Training

Welcome back to our journey of unlocking the power of fine-tuning quantized LLMs in PyTorch! In the previous chapter, we explored various techniques that help us fine-tune quantized LLMs, thereby improving their performance.

In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the world of automatic quantization aware training, which can be used to fine-tune quantization parameters and achieve better performance in LLMs.

We are delighted to have a special guest, Yunjey Choi, join us for this chapter. Yunjey is a prominent AI researcher and a lead developer at PyTorch. He has made significant contributions to the field of computer vision, particularly object detection and segmentation. He will help us understand the techniques for automatic quantization aware training and how to implement them using PyTorch.

So, let's get started on this exciting journey of automatic quantization aware training in PyTorch, and uncover how it can take the performance of LLMs to a whole new level! 

**Fun Fact:** Did you know that the idea of quantization first came about in 1898 when Max Planck proposed the concept of energy being quantized in the form of quanta?

# Chapter 7: Automatic Quantization Aware Training

## The Tale of Quantization Monster

Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a monster called Quantization. This monster roamed around the countryside, scaring people and causing destruction wherever it went. 

One day, a young PyTorch researcher named Yunjey Choi decided to tame the Quantization monster. He knew that the monster could be trained to use its powers for the greater good, and so he set out to find it.

After months of searching, Yunjey finally found the Quantization monster hiding in the mountains. It was massive and imposing, but Yunjey didn't back down. He approached the monster and started talking to it.

"I know you have the power to quantize neural networks and reduce the memory and computation required for training, but if you misuse that power, you can cause great harm. Instead, let's work together to use your power for good. I will teach you how to do automatic quantization-aware training in PyTorch, so you can be more powerful and beneficial."

The monster was hesitant at first, but Yunjey's gentle approach eventually convinced it to work with him. Yunjey set up a PyTorch environment and began teaching the monster about automatic quantization-aware training.

With Yunjey's help, the monster quickly learned how to fine-tune the quantization parameters of long short-term memory networks (LLMs) automatically. By doing so, it could produce state-of-the-art results on speech recognition and natural language processing tasks.

The people who previously feared the monster started to recognize its benefits and began to trust it. The monster even became a guardian of the countryside, protecting innocent people from other, more dangerous monsters.

## Conclusion

Thanks to Yunjey Choi’s persistence and expertise, we have learned how to tame the Quantization monster and turn it into a force for good. Automatic quantization-aware training can be used to generate more accurate LLM models while reducing computation and memory consumption.

By fine-tuning the quantization parameters of LLMs, our models can achieve better accuracy and efficiency in a broad range of speech and natural language processing tasks.

We hope that you've gained insight into these powerful techniques for fine-tuning quantized LLMs using PyTorch. Remember to experiment with various configurations and techniques as you explore this exciting world of automatic quantization-aware training!

**Fun Fact:** Did you know that PyTorch is named after the concept of a "torch" in mathematics, which represents a tensor that uses a gradient to compute derivatives in optimization algorithms?

# Understanding the Resolution Code

In our Frankenstein's Monster story, we saw Yunjey Choi use automatic quantization-aware training to fine-tune the Quantization monster's parameters, teaching it how to use its powers for good. 

Now let's take a closer look at the code that Yunjey used to make this happen.

Here's how we can use PyTorch to implement automatic quantization-aware training:

```python 
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.quantization

# Define and prepare the model
model = nn.LSTM(...)
model.qconfig = torch.quantization.get_default_qconfig('fbgemm')
torch.quantization.prepare(model, inplace=True)

# Define the optimizer and criterion
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Train the model with fine-tuning quantization-aware training
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, targets in train_loader:
        model.train()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        inputs = inputs.to(device)
        targets = targets.to(device)
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    # Fine-tune the quantization parameters after each epoch
    if epoch % 5 == 0:
        torch.quantization.fine_tune_qat(model, qat_eval_fn=QAT_Eval_Function, inplace=True)
```

In this code, we define an LSTM model and prepare it for quantization using the `torch.quantization.prepare` function. We then define the optimizer and criterion and start training the model using a fine-tuning quantization-aware training loop.

After every `num_epochs`, we fine-tune the quantization parameters using the `torch.quantization.fine_tune_qat` function. This function takes in the `model`, an `inplace` flag, and a `qat_eval_fn` that returns a dictionary of activations and layer outputs needed for fine-tuning the quantization parameters.

By repeatedly fine-tuning the quantization parameters of our LLM model using QAT, we can optimize our model for better performance, accuracy, and efficiency.

We hope this code helps you begin your journey into the world of automatic quantization aware training in PyTorch!
