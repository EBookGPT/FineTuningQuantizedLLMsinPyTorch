# Chapter 14: Converting a Floating-Point Model to a Quantized Model

Welcome to the fourteenth chapter of our book on Fine Tuning Quantized LLMs in PyTorch! In the previous chapter, we explored how to simulate quantization on a CPU. Now, we will delve into how to convert a floating-point model to a quantized model.

We are thrilled to introduce our special guest, Fakrul Alam Pappu. As a deep learning enthusiast and a software engineer, Fakrul Alam Pappu has worked on various projects involving deep learning models. His expertise in machine learning and passion for exploring new horizons of the field has made him one of the most prominent figures in the tech world. In this chapter, we will explore how a floating-point model can be converted into a quantized model with the help of PyTorch and also we will have insights from Pappu on how to tackle challenges during the conversion process.

Quantization brings several benefits to machine learning, including faster inference time with low latency, low memory usage, and lower power consumption. That makes it an appealing approach for mobile, Edge, and IoT devices. Although training a model using a floating-point representation is commonly practiced, deploying it on edge devices requires conversion to a quantized format.

As we embark on the journey of converting a floating-point model to a quantized model, we will explore how to fine-tune the quantized model to ensure that its performance is as close to the floating-point model as possible. It's important to keep in mind that quantization causes irretrievable loss of information. Therefore, if we have a floating-point model with very high accuracy, we need to take necessary steps to ensure the loss of information does not affect the overall performance of the model.

We will use PyTorch's Quantization API to quantize our model. As we dive deeper into this process, we will also explore some of the challenges and limitations associated with model quantization. In particular, we will investigate the effect of quantization on accuracy and how to fine-tune the quantized model to minimize this effect.

We hope to equip you with the knowledge, skills, and tools to convert your floating-point model to a quantized model and leverage the advantages of quantization in your machine learning projects. Let's get started!
# Chapter 14: Converting a Floating-Point Model to a Quantized Model

Once upon a time, in a far-off land, Dracula was a brilliant data scientist. He had been working on an NLP project where he had trained a language model using a large corpus of data. The model was based on the Transformer architecture and had achieved state-of-the-art performance on the task at hand. However, Dracula realized that if he wanted to deploy his model on edge devices or mobile phones, it would need to be converted to a quantized model.

Dracula had heard that converting a floating-point model to a quantized model was not an easy task, and he was wary of the challenges he might face. But he was willing to take on this challenge as it would be beneficial in reducing the model size, which would be particularly useful for smaller devices with limited storage capacity.

Dracula consulted his trusted PyTorch documentation and started by creating a test subset of his data to evaluate the accuracy of the quantized model. He began by fine-tuning the model's weights and biases with PyTorch's Quantization API. However, during the conversion process, Dracula noticed that the quantized model's accuracy had decreased significantly. This was because the quantization caused an irretrievable loss of information.

Dracula was upset to see the decline in model accuracy. He reached out to his colleagues for help, but none of them had faced this challenge before. Frustrated and out of ideas, he remembered our special guest, Fakrul Alam Pappu, whom he had met at a recent machine learning conference.

Dracula discussed the problem with Pappu, who had worked on several projects involving model quantization. He provided Dracula with some valuable insights and guidance on how to tackle the issue. Fakrul Alam Pappu suggested that Dracula should fine-tune the quantized model's weights and biases using a smaller learning rate than the floating-point model. This would help minimize the accuracy loss and make the model's performance as close to the floating-point model as possible.

Dracula heeded Pappu's advice and tried fine-tuning the quantized model with a smaller learning rate. To his delight, he found that this approach significantly improved the accuracy of the quantized model. With Pappu's insights and guidance, Dracula was able to overcome the challenges of converting his floating-point language model to a quantized model.

In conclusion, converting a floating-point model to a quantized model can be a challenging task. Fine-tuning the quantized model and minimizing the accuracy loss requires careful considerations. However, with the help of PyTorch's quantization API and insights from experts like Fakrul Alam Pappu, it is possible to overcome these challenges and leverage the advantages of quantization to meet the requirements of edge devices and mobile phones.
To resolve the challenges of converting a floating-point model to a quantized model as mentioned in the Dracula story, we used PyTorch's Quantization API.

The first step of the process is to create a test subset of the data to evaluate the accuracy of the quantized model. We then proceed with the following steps:

### Fine-tuning the model's weights and biases
``` python
import torch
from torch.quantization import QuantStub, DeQuantStub

class Model(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Model, self).__init__()
        self.quant = QuantStub()
        self.dequant = DeQuantStub()
        self.layer = torch.nn.Linear(10, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.quant(x)
        x = self.layer(x)
        x = self.dequant(x)
        return x

model = Model()
quantized_model = torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(
    model, 
    {torch.nn.Linear}, 
    dtype=torch.qint8
)
```
We first define our model and then use the `QuantStub` and `DeQuantStub` to specify which parts of the model we want to be quantized. Then, we use PyTorch's `quantize_dynamic` function to convert the floating-point model to a quantized model. We can specify which layers we want to be quantized by passing them as a set to the second argument of the `quantize_dynamic` function. In this case, we passed `torch.nn.Linear` as the only layer to be quantized.

### Fine-tuning the quantized model's weights and biases
``` python
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(
    quantized_model.parameters(), 
    lr=1e-5
)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch_idx, (inputs, targets) in enumerate(train_loader):
        quantized_model.train()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = quantized_model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```
After converting the model, we need to fine-tune its weights and biases to minimize accuracy loss. To fine-tune the quantized model, we use PyTorch's optimizer functions. We specify the parameters to be optimized as the parameters of the quantized model. We also use a smaller learning rate than the one used for the floating-point model. 

Following the fine-tuning process, we can compare the accuracy of the quantized model to the floating-point model on the test set to ensure that the accuracy loss is minimized. By following these steps, we can overcome the challenges of converting a floating-point model to a quantized model, as demonstrated in the Dracula story.
