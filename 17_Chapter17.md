# Chapter 17: Conclusion

Welcome to the conclusion of our epic journey through the world of Fine Tuning Quantized LLMs in PyTorch, where we explored the depths of quantization and low-level models, as well as the various techniques for fine-tuning these models. 

In this book, we began by exploring the basics of quantization and LLMs. We then progressed to learn how to determine optimal quantization settings for our models, along with a variety of other important topics such as automatic quantization aware training and calibration algorithms.

We also covered the types of LLMs that are commonly used in PyTorch quantization, and provided detailed techniques for fine-tuning quantized models in different domains such as images, video and language. Throughout the book, we have demonstrated how to simulate quantization on a CPU, convert floating-point to quantized models, and apply quantization with dynamic input shapes.

In the previous chapter, we enlisted one of the legends of the deep learning world, Yann LeCun, to guide us on future research directions in Quantization and LLMs. In our epic journey, we have covered a lot of ground, but we understand that the world of deep learning is constantly evolving and we need to drive our research in directions that benefit the community in the long run.

The importance of quantization cannot be overstated, with models that have been quantized showing significant improvement in terms of accuracy and speed over the floating-point models. However, there is still a lot of work to be done in this space, and we look forward to future breakthroughs.

With that said, let us conclude our journey through the world of Fine Tuning Quantized LLMs in PyTorch. We hope that you have found this book both interesting and informative, and that it has provided you with the knowledge and tools necessary to tackle the challenges of quantization and low-level models in your own research.

Thank you for being a part of our epic story, and we wish you all the best on your own journey through the wondrous world of deep learning!
# Chapter 17: The Quest for Deep Learning Mastery

Once upon a time, in a realm far away, there was a band of warriors on a quest for deep learning mastery. They sought to improve their models' speed and efficiency, without compromising on accuracy. And so, they set out on their journey through the world of Fine Tuning Quantized LLMs in PyTorch.

Their journey began with an introduction to the concept of quantization and low-level models, as well as the various techniques used in PyTorch for quantization. As they progressed, they learned about determining optimal quantization settings for their models, and the different types of LLMs that exist in PyTorch.

But their journey was not without challenges. The warriors soon encountered the complex process involved in fine-tuning quantized LLMs, and the various techniques used for this purpose. They were determined to master this process, as it was crucial to achieving their ultimate goal of deep learning mastery.

Thankfully, they were not alone on their journey. They were joined by the wise Yann LeCun, a legendary figure in the world of deep learning research. With his guidance, they delved further into the world of quantization and LLMs, exploring topics such as automatic quantization aware training and calibration algorithms.

As they traveled further, they encountered new challenges such as simulating quantization on a CPU, converting floating-point models to quantized models, and applying quantization with dynamic input shapes. But with each new obstacle, they persevered, driven by their desire for deep learning mastery.

And so, the warriors' quest came to an end, with the conclusion of their journey through the world of Fine Tuning Quantized LLMs in PyTorch. They had gained the knowledge and tools necessary to conquer the challenges of deep learning, and achieve their ultimate goal of mastery.

As the warriors parted ways, they knew that their journey was not truly over. The realm of deep learning was constantly evolving, and there was still much to discover and explore. But they were ready for any challenge that lay ahead, armed with the knowledge and experience gained from their epic quest.

Farewell, brave warriors, and thank you for joining us on this journey through the wondrous world of Fine Tuning Quantized LLMs in PyTorch.
Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot display the code used to resolve the Greek Mythology epic for the chapter on Fine Tuning Quantized LLMs in PyTorch. 

However, throughout this book, we have provided code samples and instructions on how to fine-tune quantized LLMs in PyTorch, allowing you to tackle the challenges of deep learning with confidence.

In chapter 5, we provided an overview of the fine-tuning process for quantized models, while chapters 6 through 14 delved deeper into specific topics such as techniques for fine-tuning image, language, and video models, and simulating quantization on a CPU. 

We also provided practical examples on how to convert a floating-point model to a quantized model, and how to implement calibration algorithms.

At the end of our journey, in chapter 17, we reflected on the knowledge and tools gained from our epic quest. While the coding process may have been challenging, the rewards of deep learning mastery are well worth it.

In conclusion, if you are interested in Fine Tuning Quantized LLMs in PyTorch, we encourage you to refer back to the previous chapters for code examples and detailed instructions on how to achieve successful model fine-tuning.
