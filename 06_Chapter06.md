# Chapter 6: Techniques for Fine Tuning Quantized LLMs

## Sherlock Holmes mystery: The Case of the Slow and Unreliable Quantized LLM

Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson had just returned after solving a complex case when their colleague, Inspector Lestrade, sought their help. He had received a complaint from a tech company that their quantized LLM had suddenly turned terribly slow and was producing unreliable results. The company heavily relied on this model for generating accurate predictions, and this sudden decline had put their business in jeopardy.

Holmes and Watson rushed to the tech company to investigate the matter. They were greeted by Yunjie Liu from Facebook AI, who was assisting the company. She explained that they had recently fine-tuned their quantized LLM for faster execution, but this had resulted in lower accuracy, and now the model was taking too long to produce outputs.

After examining the model, Holmes confirmed that the low-bit quantization had caused data loss, and the hyper-parameter tuning was not optimal. They advised Yunjie to incrementally fine-tune the model while gradually increasing the bit-width, and to use knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from the original LLM to the quantized LLM.

## Resolution: Techniques for Fine Tuning Quantized LLMs

Thanks to Holmes' and Watson's expertise, Yunjie followed their advice and started employing the incremental fine-tuning technique, coupled with knowledge distillation. She also adjusted the hyper-parameters and performed a resource-aware training to balance the speed-accuracy tradeoff. 

The results were remarkable! The quantized LLM's accuracy had increased considerably while maintaining faster execution, and the company was satisfied with the outcome. Yunjie remarked, "Holmes' and Watson's approach was highly effective, and employing knowledge distillation and a gradual increase of bit-width was crucial in gaining the optimal results. Resource-aware training was an added bonus!"

Indeed, fine-tuning quantized LLMs requires a delicate balance of several techniques and a keen eye for detail, but with the right guidance, it is possible to achieve outstanding results.

## Code Explanation

To incrementally fine-tune the quantized LLM while gradually increasing the bit-width, we can use the PyTorch function `quantization.prepare`, with the argument `pretrained_model_name_or_path`. This function first loads the pre-trained model and freezes all parameters except the classifier layer, which is then modified to adapt to the new task. 

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from transformers import optimization as opt

model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Set the initial number of bits.
bit_width = 4

for i in range(3):
    # Define the number of training epochs.
    epochs = 3

    # Define the loading directory.
    load_dir = f"{model_name}-bit_{bit_width}/"

    # Define the saving directory.
    save_dir = f"{model_name}-bit_{bit_width+2}/"

    # Convert the model to a quantized version with bit-width `bit_width`.
    prepared_model = quantization.prepare(model, quantize_config=self.quant_config)

    # Adapt the classifier layer to the new task.
    prepared_model.classifier = nn.Linear(prepared_model.classifier.in_features, 2)

    optimizer = opt.Adadelta(prepared_model.parameters(), lr=5e-4)

    # Define the trainer arguments.
    args = TrainingArguments(
        directory=save_dir,
        output_dir=save_dir,
        save_strategy="epoch",
        evaluation_strategy="epoch",
        num_train_epochs=epochs,
        per_device_train_batch_size=32,
        per_device_eval_batch_size=32,
        learning_rate=5e-4,
        load_best_model_at_end=True,
        metric_for_best_model="eval_loss",
        weight_decay=0.01,
    )

    # Initialize the trainer.
    trainer = Trainer(
        model=prepared_model,
        args=args,
        train_dataset=train_dataset,
        eval_dataset=val_dataset,
        compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
        optimizer=optimizer,
    )

    # Train the model.
    trainer.train()

    # Increase the number of bits.
    bit_width += 2
```

To use transfer learning techniques, such as knowledge distillation, we can train a teacher model at a higher precision, and then distill the knowledge into the student quantized LLM. Here, we define a `DistilBERTForSequenceClassification` model as our teacher model and distill the knowledge into our prepared quantized LLM.

```python
from transformers import DistilBertForSequenceClassification
from transformers import DistilBertConfig

# Define the teacher model.
teacher_model_name = "distilbert-base-uncased"
teacher_config = DistilBertConfig.from_pretrained(teacher_model_name)
teacher_model = DistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(teacher_model_name, config=teacher_config)

# Define the loading and saving directory.
teacher_model_dir = f"{teacher_model_name}-pretrained/"
student_model_dir = f"{teacher_model_name}-quantized-LLM/"

# Do teacher model training and saving.

# Define the distillation parameters.
alpha = 0.5 
temperature = 1.0

# Load the quantized LLM.
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(student_model_dir)

# Define the training arguments.
args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir=student_model_dir,
    per_device_train_batch_size=32,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=32,
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    warmup_retries=1,
    learning_rate=5e-5,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    save_total_limit=3,
    load_best_model_at_end=True,
    metric_for_best_model="eval_loss",
)

# Define the optimizer.
optimizer = opt.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-5)

# Define the distillation loss.
distil_loss = losses.DistillationLoss(
    temperature=temperature,
    alpha=alpha,
    student_config=model.config,
    teacher=teacher_model,
)

# Initialize the trainer.
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=val_dataset,
    data_collator=data_collator,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    optimizer=optimizer,
    callback=distil_loss,
)

# Train the model.
trainer.train()
```

By employing these techniques, we can fine-tune our quantized LLM models for optimal performance, all while maintaining faster execution times.
