Welcome back, dear reader! In the previous chapter, we delved into the concept of Quantization Aware Training using PyTorch. As we progress through the journey of mastering Fine Tuning Quantized LLMs in PyTorch, we have an exciting guest with us, and we can't wait to introduce him to you.

We are thrilled to have Dr. Jan Kautz, an esteemed researcher in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning as our special guest for this chapter. He is known for his work on GANs, Image Processing, and deep learning techniques that improve image quality, and more specifically to this chapter, efficient quantization of neural networks.

In this chapter, we will focus on fine-tuning quantized image models. We will take you through the steps of quantizing a pre-trained model using PyTorch, followed by fine-tuning the model to improve its performance. Dr. Kautz will be sharing his proficiency by guiding us through state-of-the-art techniques for fine-tuning quantized image models. 

Through this exciting journey with Dr. Kautz, you will understand how to improve the accuracy and efficiency of pre-trained models specifically in the domain of quantized image models. We will also learn how to fine-tune models on specific datasets using knowledge transfer techniques, resulting in better performance of the model.

So, dear reader, sharpen your skills, and join us on this adventure to master the art of Fine Tuning Quantized LLMs in PyTorch. Are you ready? Let's dive right in!

# Fun Fact

Did you know that a face recognition algorithm can be tricked by adding digital noise to an image? A study by researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics and Stanford University showed that adding noise to an image can fool a face recognition algorithm with an accuracy of up to 100%.

# Chapter 9 - Fine-tuning Quantized Image Models

## The Dracula Story

The sun had set on the quaint town, and the moon had taken its place amidst the dark, stormy clouds. The people were calm, taking refuge in their cozy homes. But in the dimly lit laboratory of Dr. Van Helsing, a dark shadow lurked. The shadow had the form of Count Dracula, and he had come to wreak havoc on the town's people.

Dr. Van Helsing was a brilliant researcher, and he had been working on an AI-powered defense mechanism to protect the town from Dracula's wrath. It was an AI face recognition system that could detect Dracula's likeness and prevent him from entering the town.

But Dracula was clever, and he knew that the AI system was vulnerable to attacks. He had employed his finest hackers to find a loophole in the system. They discovered that the system's neural network was not properly quantized, making it weak and inefficient.

Dracula saw the opportunity and decided to act. He sneaked into the laboratory and tampered with the system's neural network, causing it to crash.

Dr. Van Helsing was devastated. He had lost so much time and effort working on the system. He decided to seek help from an expert in the field, Dr. Jan Kautz.

Dr. Kautz was excited to help Dr. Van Helsing. He had extensive experience in deep learning and computer vision, and he knew just what to do. He immediately worked on quantizing the neural network, making it more efficient and accurate.

Next, Dr. Kautz fine-tuned the neural network using transfer learning on a specific dataset of images of Dracula's likeness. He didn't train the network from scratch but used the pre-trained model and fine-tuned it, which significantly reduced the training time.

Dr. Van Helsing was grateful for Dr. Kautz's expertise, and he tested the system. It achieved 95% accuracy, and the town was saved from Dracula's curse.

## The Resolution

In this chapter, we learned how to fine-tune quantized image models, and Dr. Kautz's expertise shifted the tide in the battle against Dracula. By quantizing pre-trained models and fine-tuning them, we improved their accuracy and efficiency.

You, dear reader, have now gained the knowledge to sharpen your skills and implement these techniques in your projects. We hope Dracula stays far away from you, and that you keep fine-tuning your quantized models to take on new challenges in the world of machine learning.

Stay tuned for the next chapter, where we will explore how to evaluate and test quantized models.
Sure, I'd be happy to explain the code used to resolve the Dracula story.

In the story, Dr. Kautz used two essential techniques to fine-tune the quantized image models - Quantization and Transfer Learning.

### Quantization

In simple terms, quantization is the process of converting a floating-point model to an integer-based model. This process leads to a reduction in the size of the model, resulting in faster inference times and efficient use of hardware resources.

To implement quantization, Dr. Kautz used PyTorch's `torch.quantization` library. 

Here is an example of how to create a quantized model:

```python
import torch
import torchvision

# load the pre-trained model
model = torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=True)

# define the input shape
input_shape = (1, 3, 224, 224)

# create the quantized model
quantized_model = torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(
    model, 
    {torch.nn.Conv2d, torch.nn.Linear},
    dtype=torch.qint8
)
```

In this example, `torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic()` is used to quantize a pre-trained ResNet18 model with a `dtype` of 8-bit integer. The `quantize_dynamic()` function replaces the floating-point operators in the model with quantized operators.

### Transfer Learning

Transfer learning is the process of taking pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on a new dataset (in our story, it was a dataset of images of Dracula's likeness). This process allows us to use the pre-trained model as a starting point, reducing the time and computation resources required for training.

To implement transfer learning, Dr. Kautz used PyTorch's `torchvision.models` module. Here's an example:

```python
import torch
import torchvision

# load the pre-trained model
model = torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=True)

# Freeze all layers except the last layer
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# Modify the number of output classes
num_classes = 2
model.fc = nn.Linear(model.fc.in_features, num_classes)

# Define the loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.fc.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)

# Load the dataset
dataset = MyDataset()
dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Fine-tune the model
for epoch in range(10):
    for inputs, labels in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

# Save the fine-tuned model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pt')
```

In this code sample, we first load a pre-trained ResNet18 model and freeze all layers except the last layer. We then modify the number of output classes to suit the specific dataset we're using. We then define the loss function and optimizer and load the dataset.

Finally, we fine-tune the model by looping over our dataset and training the last layer using the optimizer. The resulting fine-tuned model can then be saved for future use.

With these two techniques, Dr. Kautz was able to fine-tune a quantized model that successfully recognized Dracula's likeness with a high degree of accuracy, ultimately saving the town from his evil deeds.
