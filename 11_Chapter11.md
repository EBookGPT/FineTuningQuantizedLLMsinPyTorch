# Chapter 11: Fine-Tuning Quantized Video Models

Welcome back, my dear readers! In the last chapter, we delved into the exciting world of fine-tuning quantized language models. Today, we will take a plunge into the realm of video models and explore how fine-tuning quantized LLMs in PyTorch can help us in this area.

For this special chapter, we have a very special guest - Debargha Mukherjee. An accomplished researcher in the field of video coding, he has authored several publications on the topic in top-tier journals and conferences. His valuable insights will help us understand the nuances of fine-tuning quantized video models.

We know that quantization plays a crucial role in reducing storage requirements and computational costs in video models. However, quantization also poses certain challenges, which make fine-tuning of such models a tad bit more tricky. Fear not, for we will guide you through the process, step by step.

We will begin by understanding the basics of video models and their quantization. Then, we will learn about the different approaches to fine-tuning such quantized models and their advantages and disadvantages. We will also look at some recent research in this area and the performance gains achieved through these methods.

So, fasten your seatbelts, my dear readers, as we embark on an exciting journey into the world of fine-tuning quantized video models.

Let's begin!
# Dracula's Fine-Tuning Adventure: Fine-Tuning Quantized Video Models

It was another dark and stormy night in Transylvania, and Dracula was feeling restless. As he pondered over different ways to spend his night, his sharp senses picked up a strange sound. It appeared to be coming from a nearby castle, and Dracula decided to investigate.

As he entered the castle, his eyes fell on a curious sight - a group of researchers huddled around a computer terminal, discussing video models and their quantization. Intrigued, Dracula decided to eavesdrop on their conversation. Little did he know that he was about to embark on a thrilling adventure that would lead him to discover the world of fine-tuning quantized video models.

The researchers soon noticed Dracula's presence and introduced themselves. They were working on a project to develop an efficient video coding system that could handle large amounts of data with minimal storage requirements. Debargha Mukherjee, a renowned expert in video coding, was leading the project. He explained to Dracula how quantization played a critical role in reducing the storage and computational costs of video models.

However, there was a catch - fine-tuning quantized video models was more complicated than fine-tuning language models. The quantization process caused a loss of information, which could lead to sub-optimal performance if not handled carefully.

Debargha and his team had been experimenting with various approaches to fine-tuning quantized video models. They shared their experiences and the performance gains they had achieved with Dracula. As a quick learner, Dracula was fascinated by the methods and asked the researchers several questions about the process.

With the researchers' guidance, Dracula set out to create his own fine-tuned quantized video models. He used PyTorch, a popular deep learning library, to load and quantize the video models. Then, he experimented with different methods to fine-tune the quantized models, such as post-training quantization and quantization-aware training. He carefully monitored the performance of the fine-tuned models and chose the best performing one.

As he sat back, satisfied with his newfound skill, he realized the importance of quantized video models and the crucial role that fine-tuning played in their development.

With that, Dracula thanked the researchers for their guidance and left the castle, ready to apply his new-found knowledge to his endeavors. As he took to the skies, he realized that no challenge was too difficult to conquer, with the right tools and guidance.

The end of Dracula's Fine-Tuning Adventure.
Certainly! The code used in the story involved fine-tuning a quantized video model. Here's a brief explanation of the PyTorch code used in resolving Dracula's Fine-Tuning Adventure:

1. Loading and Quantizing the Video Model - The first step involved loading a pre-trained video model and applying quantization to it using PyTorch's quantization APIs. This was achieved through the following code:

```python
# Load the pre-trained model
model = load_pretrained_video_model()

# Quantize the model
quantizer = torch.quantization.QuantStub()
dequantizer = torch.quantization.DeQuantStub()
model = nn.Sequential(quantizer, model, dequantizer)
model.qconfig = torch.quantization.get_default_qconfig('fbgemm')
torch.quantization.prepare(model, inplace=True)
```

2. Fine-Tuning the Quantized Model - Once the model was quantized, various methods were applied to fine-tune the model. Post-training quantization was one such method, where the quantization was applied to the weights and activations of the model after it had been trained. Quantization-aware training was another method, which involved training the model while keeping the quantization in mind. The following code demonstrates the application of post-training quantization:

```python
# Train the model
train_video_model(model)

# Apply post-training quantization
torch.quantization.convert(model, inplace=True)
```

3. Monitoring Performance of the Fine-Tuned Model - Finally, the performance of the fine-tuned model was monitored to determine the best performing one. This was achieved by evaluating the model on a validation dataset and measuring the accuracy. The following code demonstrates how this was done:

```python
# Evaluate performance on validation dataset
valid_data_loader = prepare_validation_data_loader()
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    for x, y in valid_data_loader:
        output = model(x)
        _, predicted = torch.max(output, 1)
        total += y.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == y).sum().item()

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = correct / total
```

And with that, the code used to resolve Dracula's Fine-Tuning Adventure comes to an end!
