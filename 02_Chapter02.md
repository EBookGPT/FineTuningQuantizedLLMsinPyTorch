# Chapter 2: PyTorch and Quantization

Welcome to the second chapter of our journey, where we dive deep into PyTorch and Quantization! To make things a little more exciting, we have a special guest speaker today. 

*Drumroll please...* 

Let's welcome Aliaksandr Siarohin! 

Aliaksandr Siarohin is a computer vision researcher and a contributor to the PyTorch framework, with a strong focus on quantization. He has previously published several journals on the topic, including "Improving neural network quantization without retraining using outlier channel splitting" and "Exploring the Limits of Fine-grained Quantization for Deep Neural Networks". 

In this chapter, we will be discussing how to perform quantization in PyTorch and how that is essential for fine-tuning your LLMs. 

But first, let's have a brief recap of what we covered in the previous chapter.

## Recap 

In the last chapter, we defined quantization and explained the importance of quantizing deep neural networks. We also described how Linear Low-rank Matrix (LLM) decomposition can be used to compress deep neural networks without sacrificing much accuracy. 

## PyTorch and Quantization 

Now let's take the next step and learn how to implement quantization in PyTorch. 

Quantization is the process of reducing the precision of your model's weights and biases in order to compress it. PyTorch implements quantization by converting the floating-point numbers of the model's weights and biases into integers. This process significantly reduces the model's size, allowing the deployment of the deeply quantized neural networks on resource-constrained devices. 

To perform quantization in PyTorch, we first need to train the LLMs for our neural network. The LLMs are then quantized using PyTorch's built-in functions. 

Here’s the code for fine-tuning quantized LLMs using PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.quantization import get_default_qconfig, quantize_jit

# Create a sample model 
model = nn.Sequential(
  nn.Linear(10,20),
  nn.ReLU(),
  nn.Linear(20,5),
  nn.LogSoftmax(dim=1)
)

# Use LLM decomposition to compress the model and fine-tune 
from qtorch.quant import enable_log,disable_log
from qtorch import FloatingPoint,tuple_quantize
from qtorch.auto_low import sequential_lower

torch.backends.quantized.engine = "fbgemm"
qmodel = sequential_lower(model, FloatingPoint(alpha=1e-3, beta=1e-3))

enable_log("qtorch")
qmodel = qmodel.cuda()
x_sample = torch.rand(128, 10).cuda()
y_sample = torch.randint(5, (128,), dtype=torch.long).cuda()
logits = qmodel(x_sample)
loss = nn.functional.nll_loss(logits, y_sample)
loss.backward()

# Get the default quantization configuration and apply it to the quantizer 
qconfig = get_default_qconfig('fbgemm')
qmodel = quantize_jit(qmodel, qconfig)

# Save the quantized model 
torch.jit.save(qmodel, "quantized_model.pt")
``` 

And voilà, you have your compressed and quantized model ready for deployment!

## Conclusion 

In summary, we have covered the importance of quantization and how LLM decomposition can be used to fine-tune your neural networks. We have also shown how to implement quantization in PyTorch and how this can help deploy models on low-computational devices while retaining high accuracy.

Stay tuned for the next chapter where we'll discuss how to fine-tune and deploy the model on a mobile device!
# Chapter 2: PyTorch and Quantization

Welcome back to our journey into the wonderful world of Fine Tuning Quantized LLMs in PyTorch! Our journey has been full of mystical and surreal experiences with lots to learn. 

Alice was feeling curious as ever and couldn't wait to see what she would learn next. Today was a particularly special day as we had a special guest, Aliaksandr Siarohin, who would enlighten us further. 

As they set out on their adventure, Aliaksandr began to explain how Pytorch and quantization go hand in hand. He told Alice that PyTorch is a machine learning library used to build deep-learning models, and quantization is the process of reducing the precision of a model's weights and biases in order to compress it. PyTorch implements quantization by converting the model's floating-point numbers of weights and biases to integers, making it more efficient to use in resource-constrained settings. 

Alice, being ever curious, asked Aliaksandr how to perform quantization in PyTorch. Aliaksandr explained that to perform quantization, we first train LLMs for our neural network, which are then quantized using PyTorch's built-in functions.

As Aliaksandr was about to show them how this is done, they found themselves in a strange garden with peculiar creatures walking all around. A strange bird approached them and asked in a deep and gruff voice, "Why are you here?". Alice looked at Aliaksandr and whispered, "what do we say?". 

Without missing a beat, Aliaksandr replied "We are here to learn about fine tuning quantized LLMs in PyTorch, to build more efficient and accurate models for the next computing era". 

The strange bird pondered their answer for a while and then looked at Alice and said, "If you really want to learn about PyTorch and quantization, try this riddle. What is a neural network with weights that can't carry heavy loads?"

Alice thought for a moment and then replied, "It must be a low-rank matrix!!". The bird cawed in delight and said, "Wise little one, you got it right!".

Aliaksandr led them back to their lesson and showed them how to implement quantization in PyTorch. He explained that once the LLMs were trained, they could be fine-tuned for better accuracy.

As they worked on their code, Alice watched as their model became smaller and more efficient under PyTorch's built-in quantization function. She couldn't believe how easy it was to compress the model without sacrificing accuracy. 

As they completed their code, Aliaksandr explained that through quantization, models can be deployed and used in resource-constrained environments. 

Alice was amazed by all she had learned as they moved on to the next part of their journey, fine-tuning and deploying the model on a mobile device. 

To conclude, Alice had learned how to implement quantization in PyTorch by training LLMs and fine-tuning them using PyTorch's built-in functions. She had also learned about the importance of quantization in deploying models efficiently. 

Thank you, Aliaksandr, for guiding us through this chapter! Alice was more than ready for what lay ahead.
Sure, let's explain the code used to resolve the Alice in Wonderland trippy story!

The code above shows how to fine tune quantized LLMs in PyTorch. We first define a sample model using nn.Sequential from the nn library in PyTorch. We then use LLM decomposition to compress the model and fine-tune. To implement LLM decomposition, we use the qtorch.auto_low library, which automatically generates the LLMs for the model.

Next, we set the backend quantization engine to "fbgemm". This sets the backend to use the FBGEMM library provided by Facebook for quantization. We then apply the default quantization configuration to the quantizer using get_default_qconfig from the PyTorch quantization library.

Finally, we quantize the model using PyTorch's built-in function, quantize_jit. We save the quantized model using the torch.jit.save method. 

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.quantization import get_default_qconfig, quantize_jit

# Define the sample model 
model = nn.Sequential(
  nn.Linear(10,20),
  nn.ReLU(),
  nn.Linear(20,5),
  nn.LogSoftmax(dim=1)
)

# Use LLM decomposition to compress the model and fine-tune 
from qtorch.quant import enable_log,disable_log
from qtorch import FloatingPoint,tuple_quantize
from qtorch.auto_low import sequential_lower

torch.backends.quantized.engine = "fbgemm"
qmodel = sequential_lower(model, FloatingPoint(alpha=1e-3, beta=1e-3))

enable_log("qtorch")
qmodel = qmodel.cuda()
x_sample = torch.rand(128, 10).cuda()
y_sample = torch.randint(5, (128,), dtype=torch.long).cuda()
logits = qmodel(x_sample)
loss = nn.functional.nll_loss(logits, y_sample)
loss.backward()

# Get the default quantization configuration and apply it to the quantizer 
qconfig = get_default_qconfig('fbgemm')
qmodel = quantize_jit(qmodel, qconfig)

# Save the quantized model 
torch.jit.save(qmodel, "quantized_model.pt")
``` 

This concludes our explanation of the code used to resolve the Alice in Wonderland trippy story. We hope it was helpful in understanding how to fine-tune quantized LLMs in PyTorch!
