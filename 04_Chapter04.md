# Chapter 4: Types of LLMs Used in PyTorch Quantization

Welcome to the fourth chapter of our journey to master PyTorch Quantization! In the previous chapter, we figured out how to determine optimal quantization settings for our models to achieve impressive results in terms of computation time and memory efficiency.

In this chapter, we'll explore the different types of Linear Layer Modules (LLMs) used in PyTorch Quantization. These LLMs play a significant role in the performance and accuracy of our quantized models. As we walk through the various LLMs, we'll analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applications.

LLMs come in various shapes and sizes. Some are more accurate but slower, while others are less accurate but faster. Knowing which LLM is preferable in different situations will help us fine-tune our quantized models for accuracy, speed, or memory efficiency, depending on our priorities.

So, fasten your seatbelts as we dive deeper into the developments of LLMs and combining them to create optimized and efficient quantized models.

But before diving into the LLMs, let's have a quick review of the steps involved in fine-tuning LLMs using PyTorch quantization.

## Steps Involved in Fine-Tuning Quantized LLMs in PyTorch
1. Create a PyTorch model using the `nn` module.
2. Use the `torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic` function to quantize the model's weights and activations.
3. Train the quantized model on the dataset.
4. Fine-tune the model to improve accuracy by either "freezing" weights or "un-freezing" them for training.
5. Use the `torch.quantization.convert` function to produce an optimized quantized model.

With these steps in mind, let's delve into the different types of LLMs that we can use in PyTorch Quantization.

# Chapter 4: Types of LLMs Used in PyTorch Quantization

## The Tale of Prometheus and the LLMs

Prometheus, the Titan God of foresight and intelligence, was renowned for his ability to design and create extraordinary things, from the first humans to the eternal flame of Olympus. One day, as he was crafting a new model called the Quantized Torch, he realized that the Linear Layer Modules (LLMs) inside the model were not performing to their fullest potential.

Prometheus knew that to create the most optimized and efficient Quantized Torch, he would have to fine-tune the LLMs, but there were various types of LLMs to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Feeling lost and unsure, Prometheus reached out to his friend and fellow Titan, Athena, the Goddess of wisdom.

Athena suggested that Prometheus explore the various types of LLMs and understand their strengths and weaknesses to determine the ideal LLM to use in the Quantized Torch. So, with Athena's guidance, Prometheus set out to explore the different LLMs.

The first type of LLM Prometheus came across was the standard `nn.Linear`. With this LLM, the model's weights and activations are quantized independently. While it is simple to use and provides a reasonable degree of accuracy, it may not be the most memory efficient as it remains in floating-point format during operations.

The next type of LLM was the `nn.quantized.Linear`. This LLM exploits the strengths of quantized arithmetic and uses per-channel quantization to minimize memory usage, which can improve efficiency. However, it takes more computation time to complete operations than the standard `nn.Linear`, which may hinder its speed.

Prometheus then stumbled upon the `nn.quantized.dynamic.Linear`, which utilizes dynamic range quantization to achieve higher accuracy for a specific range of values. The dynamic nature of this LLM allows it to be applied to different sets of input data without requiring multiple passes to collect statistics. However, it has a more memory-intensive implementation than the previous LLM.

Lastly, Prometheus learned about the `nn.intrinsic.quantized.LinearReLU` LLM, which incorporates ReLU activation functionality to reduce negative weight values' need. This LLM is fast and accurate but may not be memory efficient when large numbers of ReLU activations are present.

After his exploration, Prometheus concluded that the `nn.quantized.Linear` LLM had the most desirable balance of memory usage and computation time for the Quantized Torch. Impressed with Prometheus's expertise, Athena praised him and shared that his findings would be helpful for other gods and goddesses who seek to create optimized and efficient models.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we traveled with Prometheus as he explored the different types of Linear Layer Modules used in PyTorch Quantization. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each type of LLM, we can make informed decisions on which LLM to use to optimize our models' performance.

With this knowledge, we can fine-tune our models to prioritize speed, accuracy, or memory usage, depending on our needs. In the next chapter, we'll delve into the `torch.quantization.fuse_modules` function and explore how combining LLMs can improve our model's efficiency.

## Resolving the Tale of Prometheus and the LLMs

In the epic tale of Prometheus and the LLMs, we learned about the different types of Linear Layer Modules (LLMs) used in PyTorch Quantization. Now, let's explore how we can implement fine-tuning with the `nn.quantized.Linear` LLM in PyTorch code.

Here's an example of how to fine-tune a quantized model using the `nn.quantized.Linear` LLM:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.quantization

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.layer2 = nn.quantized.Linear(5, 2, bias=True, dtype=torch.qint8)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.layer1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.layer2(x)
        return x

model = MyModel()
model.qconfig = torch.quantization.get_default_qconfig('fbgemm')
torch.quantization.prepare(model, inplace=True)
# Train your model normally here
torch.quantization.convert(model, inplace=True)
```

In the above code, we define our model using `nn.Linear`, `nn.ReLU`, and `nn.quantized.Linear`. Next, we set the `qconfig` for our model to the default `fbgemm` configuration, which is a popular configuration for CPUs. We then use the `torch.quantization.prepare` function to prepare our model for quantization. Finally, we convert the `nn.Linear` and `nn.ReLU` to the `nn.quantized.Linear` and `nn.quantized.ReLU` respectively using the `torch.quantization.convert` function.

Once our model is prepared and converted to its quantized version, we can fine-tune the model by freezing some weights and re-training the model on our data using the typical data loading and optimizer steps. For example, to freeze the first layer of the `nn.quantized.Linear` and train the model, we can modify the previous code by adding the lines:

```python
model.layer2.weight.requires_grad = False
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01, momentum=0.5)
for epoch in range(10):
    for data, target in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = loss_fn(output, target)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

As shown, we disable gradient updates for the `nn.quantized.Linear` layer, so only the final layer's weights are optimized during training.

By fine-tuning our quantized model using the `nn.quantized.Linear` LLM and implementing other optimization techniques, we can design and train models that are both efficient and accurate. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we saw how we could fine-tune our quantized model using the `nn.quantized.Linear` LLM in PyTorch code. By carefully selecting the appropriate LLM and implementing our fine-tuning techniques, we can achieve the desired performance and accuracy from our models. In the next chapter, we'll explore the `torch.quantization.fuse_modules` function and see how we can further optimize our quantized models.
