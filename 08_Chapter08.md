# Chapter 8: Fine Tuning Quantized LLMs in PyTorch - Quantization Aware Training

In the previous chapter, we learned about Automatic Quantization Aware Training, a technique that automatically quantizes the weights and activations of a given model during the training phase. While the automatic quantization method provides an easy and quick way to convert a high-precision model to a quantized low-precision model, it may not always be the optimal choice in terms of accuracy and performance.

In this chapter, we will introduce Quantization Aware Training (QAT), a powerful technique that fine-tunes a high-precision model to a low-precision model using PyTorch. QAT has been shown to outperform automatic quantization in terms of accuracy, especially when applied to complex deep learning models with a large number of parameters. 

During QAT, the model is trained with modified training data that simulates potential quantization errors. The weights and activations are quantized to a lower bit precision such as INT8, but instead of static quantization used in the automatic quantization method, QAT applies dynamic quantization in every forward pass. This way, the model learns to adapt to potential quantization errors and improves its accuracy on low-precision hardware.

We will cover the following topics in this chapter:
- Understanding QAT and its benefits
- Implementing QAT using PyTorch
- Fine-tuning a quantized model using QAT
- Best practices and tips for successful QAT training
- Performance comparison of QAT and automatic quantization

So, join me on this journey to explore the world of QAT and learn how to fine-tune your quantized models for even better performance and accuracy!
# Frankenstein's Monster: A Tale of Fine Tuning Quantized LLMs in PyTorch

Deep in the secluded PyTorch Laboratory, a young scientist named Victor had an idea to create a new Frankenstein's monster - a low-precision model that could run fast on low-end hardware while maintaining high accuracy.

He had already created a high-precision model, but it was not suitable for deployment on low-precision hardware. Determined to bring his creation to life, Victor began experimenting with automatic quantization. The process worked well, and his model became leaner, but it came at the cost of accuracy.

Victor grew restless and determined to bring his monster to life with even greater accuracy. He started researching the method of QAT and immersed himself in the technique. He learned that QAT is a powerful method that fine-tunes his model to a low-precision model using dynamic quantization.

He quickly commenced the process of fine-tuning his model using QAT. During the training phase, he deliberately induced quantization errors into the training data to simulate real-world scenarios. He monitored the progress of his model, and with each training iteration, it evolved and began adapting to the inevitability of quantization errors during inference.

Victor knew he was getting close to creating his low-precision monster. He continued to fine-tune his model until it reached the desired level of accuracy without sacrificing speed. When he finally tested his creation, he was amazed at the results. His monster now ran efficiently on low-precision hardware and was far beyond what he had initially imagined.

He had successfully created a Frankenstein's monster of quantization-aware low-precision models by using PyTorch's Quantization Aware Training technique.

# Resolution:

Thanks to Victor's research, we now know that Quantization Aware Training is a powerful tool in fine-tuning low-precision models while maintaining high accuracy. By simulating real-world quantization errors during the training phase, we teach our models to adapt to such errors and improve their performance on low-precision hardware.

With PyTorch, the implementation of QAT is simple and effective. It allows us to optimize our models for specific hardware while maintaining high accuracy.

So, let us begin the journey of Fine Tuning Quantized LLMs in PyTorch with Quantization Aware Training, and create our own Frankenstein's monster - a model that is efficient and accurate on low-precision hardware.
Sure! Let's dive into the code used to fine-tune our quantized low-precision model using PyTorch's Quantization Aware Training (QAT).

## Step 1: Define the Model

First, we need to define our original high-precision model that we want to quantize and fine-tune using QAT. We can define our model as usual using PyTorch, and define our forward pass. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1, bias=False)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(64)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU(inplace=True)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1, bias=False)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm2d(64)
        self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1, bias=False)
        self.bn3 = nn.BatchNorm2d(64)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.bn1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        x = self.bn2(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.conv3(x)
        x = self.bn3(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        return x
```

## Step 2: Convert Model to Quantized Version

Next, we need to convert our model to its quantized version. We can use the `torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic` function to convert our model to a dynamic quantized version.

```python
import torch.quantization

# Convert the model to a quantized version
quantized_model = torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(
    model,  # Our original high-precision model
    {nn.Conv2d},  # Specify which layers to quantize
    dtype=torch.qint8
)
```

## Step 3: Define the Quantization-Aware Training Function

We can define our QAT training function using the `torch.quantization.prepare` and `torch.quantization.convert` methods. These methods will prepare the model for quantization by inserting fake-quantization operations into the model.

```python
from torch import optim

# Define the QAT training function
def train(model, train_loader, criterion, optimizer, epoch, log_interval):
    model.train()
    model.qconfig = torch.quantization.get_default_qat_qconfig('fbgemm')
    model = torch.quantization.prepare_qat(model, inplace=True)
    
    for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = criterion(output, target)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
        if batch_idx % log_interval == 0:
            print('Train Epoch: {} [{}/{} ({:.0f}%)]\tLoss: {:.6f}'.format(
                epoch, batch_idx * len(data), len(train_loader.dataset),
                100. * batch_idx / len(train_loader), loss.item()))
            
    model = torch.quantization.convert(model, inplace=True)
    return model
```

## Step 4: Train the Quantized Model

Finally, we can train our quantized low-precision model using the QAT training function we defined in Step 3. We can use our regular training loop, but use our QAT function instead.

```python
# Train the quantized model using QAT
num_epochs = 10
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    quantized_model = train(quantized_model, train_loader, criterion, optimizer, epoch, log_interval)
```

That's it! By following these simple steps, we can fine-tune our quantized low-precision model using PyTorch's Quantization Aware Training technique.
