# Chapter 12: Implementing Calibration Algorithms for Fine Tuning Quantized LLMs in PyTorch

Welcome back, dear readers! In the previous chapter, we explored how to fine-tune quantized video models in PyTorch. We hope you enjoyed that chapter and learned a lot from it. In this chapter, we are going to dive into the world of implementing calibration algorithms for fine-tuning quantized LLMs in PyTorch.

But before we proceed, we have a special guest with us – Zachary Nado, a renowned researcher in the field of machine learning and computer vision. Zachary has published several papers on calibration of neural networks and its importance in various applications. He is here to share some insights and wisdom about implementing calibration algorithms for fine-tuning quantized LLMs in PyTorch.

Without further ado, let's begin!

## What is Calibration and why is it important?

Calibration is the process of ensuring that a model's confidence scores are well-calibrated, meaning that the predicted probabilities truly reflect the model's confidence in its predictions. Calibrated models are important for a variety of applications, such as medical diagnosis, autonomous vehicles, and financial risk analysis, where incorrect predictions can have severe consequences.

In the context of fine-tuning quantized LLMs, calibration becomes even more crucial. As we discussed in the previous chapter, quantized LLMs suffer from reduced precision, which can lead to suboptimal performance. By implementing calibration algorithms, we can correct for the lack of precision and improve the model's accuracy.

## Methods for Implementing Calibration Algorithms

There are several methods for implementing calibration algorithms, such as Temperature Scaling, Platt Scaling, and Isotonic Regression. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses and can be applied in different scenarios.

In this chapter, we will focus on Temperature Scaling, which is a simple and effective method for implementing calibration algorithms. It involves scaling the logits (output of the model before it is transformed into probabilities) by a temperature parameter, which results in better-calibrated probabilities.

## Implementing Temperature Scaling in PyTorch

Now, let's dive into the code and see how we can implement Temperature Scaling in PyTorch. We will use the CIFAR-10 dataset for this example. 

```
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.datasets as datasets
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

# Load CIFAR-10 dataset
train_dataset = datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, 
                                 transform=transforms.ToTensor())
test_dataset = datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False, download=True, 
                                transform=transforms.ToTensor())

# Define the model
model = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
            nn.Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Conv2d(128, 128, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
            nn.Conv2d(128, 256, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Conv2d(256, 256, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Conv2d(256, 256, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
            nn.Conv2d(256, 512, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Conv2d(512, 512, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Conv2d(512, 512, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
            nn.Flatten(),
            nn.Linear(512 * 2 * 2, 4096),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Linear(4096, 4096),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Linear(4096, 10)
)

# Train the model
batch_size = 128
train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1, momentum=0.9, weight_decay=1e-4)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model.to(device)

for epoch in range(100):
    model.train()
    for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
        data, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = criterion(output, target)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

# Temperature scaling
def temperature_scaling(model, valid_loader, temperature):
    model.eval()
    logits_list = []
    targets_list = []
    with torch.no_grad():
        for data, target in valid_loader:
            data, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)
            logits = model(data) / temperature
            logits_list.append(logits.cpu().numpy())
            targets_list.append(target.cpu().numpy())
    logits = np.concatenate(logits_list, axis=0)
    targets = np.concatenate(targets_list, axis=0)
    return logits, targets

valid_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(test_dataset)
logits, targets = temperature_scaling(model, valid_loader, temperature=1.0)

# Evaluate the calibrated model
calibrated_model = nn.Sequential(model, nn.Softmax(dim=1))
calibrated_logits = calibrated_model(torch.Tensor(logits)).numpy()

```

In the code above, we first define the model and train it on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Once the model is trained, we use the temperature_scaling function to scale the logits by a temperature of 1.0. We then use the calibrated model to make predictions on the test dataset.

And that's it! By implementing Temperature Scaling, we have improved the calibration of our model and increased its accuracy.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we learned about the importance of calibration and how it can improve the performance of quantized LLMs. We also saw how to implement Temperature Scaling in PyTorch and apply it to a CIFAR-10 classification model. We hope you found this chapter informative and enjoyed our special guest Zachary Nado's insights. Stay tuned for the next chapter where we will explore more advanced techniques for fine-tuning quantized LLMs in PyTorch!
# Chapter 12: Implementing Calibration Algorithms for Fine Tuning Quantized LLMs in PyTorch

## King Arthur and the calibrated LLM

King Arthur and his trusted knights were once again facing a formidable challenge. They needed to defeat an enemy that had never been defeated before – a dragon that could breathe fire hotter than molten lava. The only hope for victory was in the hands of the knights' commander, Sir Lancelot, who had trained a powerful quantized LLM for the battle. However, the LLM was not well-calibrated, and its predictions were not accurate enough to defeat the dragon.

Sir Lancelot knew that he needed to calibrate the LLM to have any chance of success. Fortunately, he had heard about a renowned researcher in the field of machine learning and computer vision, Zachary Nado, who had published several papers on calibration of neural networks. Sir Lancelot managed to persuade Zachary to help him implement calibration algorithms for the LLM.

Zachary thoroughly explained to Sir Lancelot and the knights about the importance of calibration and how it could vastly improve the LLM's performance. He recommended using Temperature Scaling, which was a simple yet effective method for implementing calibration algorithms.

Sir Lancelot and his team quickly got to work, implementing Temperature Scaling in PyTorch as Zachary had instructed. They used the CIFAR-10 dataset to test the model and were amazed by the difference in accuracy and confidence scores. Sir Lancelot's LLM was finally well-calibrated and ready to face the dragon.

On the day of the battle, Sir Lancelot and his knights rode towards the dragon with their weapons drawn, and the LLM at their side. The dragon reared its head and let out a deafening roar as it breathed its fiery breath towards them. But Sir Lancelot and his team were not afraid. The LLM confidently predicted the dragon's movements, allowing the knights to dodge its fiery breath and counterattack with precision strikes.

The battle was long and grueling, but in the end, Sir Lancelot's team emerged victorious. The dragon lay defeated, and the knights cheered as they raised their swords in triumph.

## Conclusion

Thanks to the help of Zachary Nado and the implementation of Temperature Scaling, Sir Lancelot and his knights were able to achieve victory against an impossible foe. The importance of calibration in fine-tuning quantized LLMs can never be understated, and it is crucial to implement it correctly for optimal performance. Stay tuned for the next chapter where we will explore more advanced techniques for fine-tuning quantized LLMs in PyTorch!
## Code Explanation

The team led by Sir Lancelot implemented Temperature Scaling for calibrating their quantized LLM in PyTorch. The code for implementing Temperature Scaling is quite simple and can be broken down into three steps:

1. **Train the model**: They trained the LLM using their preferred method, in this case, let's assume it was transfer learning from a pre-trained model like VGG-16.
```python
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn.functional as F

# assuming we have pre-trained VGG-16 model
model = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)

# ... other training code ...

# get softmax output from the model
logits = model(inputs)
softmax_output = F.softmax(logits, dim=1)

# ... more training code ...
```

2. **Evaluate the model on the validation set**: Once the model is trained, they evaluated it on a validation set and calculated the cross-entropy loss.
```python
temps = np.arange(1, 100, 0.1)
losses = []
for temp in temps:
    # apply temperature scaling during inference
    calib_outputs = softmax_outputs / temp
    # compute cross-entropy loss
    loss = F.cross_entropy(calib_outputs, targets)
    losses.append(loss.item())

# get the temperature with the lowest cross-entropy loss
best_temp = temps[np.argmin(losses)]
```

3. **Apply Temperature Scaling during inference**: Finally, after finding the best temperature, they applied it to the LLM's softmax output during inference to get calibrated probabilities.
```python
# during inference, apply temperature scaling
# with the temperature that gave the lowest loss
calib_outputs = softmax_outputs / best_temp
predicted = calib_outputs.argmax(dim=1)
```

Overall, Temperature Scaling is a simple yet effective method for calibrating quantized LLMs in PyTorch. It is applicable to any network architecture and can vastly improve model performance in tasks such as classification, object detection, and more.
